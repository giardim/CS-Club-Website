    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>The Computer Science Club is focused on software-centric projects and events. 
        The club introduces students to the world of Computer Science in a collaborative way.
         We aim to familiarize our members with various computer systems, operating systems and 
        programming languages. With our CS faculty support -- 
        which hold lectures for anyone to attend -- we hope to include a variety of students from 
        all majors.</p>

<div id = "whatwedo">
    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>Every semester, the club votes on what project they want to pursue. Through these projects
        we learn how to code in a team environment. We want to make sure students are 
        prepared for real world in a fun and relaxed setting.
    </p>
    <p>
        This semester we had the opportunity to work on an arcade cabinet, which will allow 
        students to create and publish their games for their peers to play.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also had funding from the Computer Science department to purchase "Duck Cars", which
         which are cars that we can program to drive autonomously.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the future, we hope to host Hackathons for students from SUNY schools
         and get people excited to program.
